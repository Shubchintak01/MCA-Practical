I want you to answer every question from that list (pull-up resistors, ALE, timers, stack, program counter, polling vs interrupt, difference between 8051 & MSP430, etc.) everything that douche could throw at me in viva-ready format short, clear, no BS, like how you’d respond during practical viva (definition + key points + example if needed).
